#Bitcoin a la future

This project is no longer maintained. It was online for some time but was not used.

Gamble on the future price of bitcoin:

* Make predictions about whether the price will be higher or lower than your target at a certain time in the future.
* Bet some bitcoin on that prediction
* Someone else can counter-bet and whoever is right takes the bitcoin.
* 10% of losers prediction goes to the site.

Been a long time since I've reviewed the code, and I've learned a lot since I wrote this. Still, the code is stable and secure.

You may use it however you like. I believe it offers a valuable service but has some inherent social flaws.
